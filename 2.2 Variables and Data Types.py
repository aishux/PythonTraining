## 2.2 Variables and Data Types

# A variable in Python is like a label for storing information. 
# You can create variables to store different types of data.
# Assigning Variables: You donâ€™t need to declare the type; Python figures it out on its own.

name = "Aishwarya"      # A string
age = 25                # An integer 
height = 5.8            # A float
is_employee = True      # A boolean
