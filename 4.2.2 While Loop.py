## 4.2.2 While Loop
# A while loop keeps running as long as a condition is True. 
# It is useful when the number of iterations is unknown beforehand.

'''
Syntax:

while condition:
    # Code block to execute while condition is True
    
'''

# Example:

count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Increment the count

# This loop will print numbers from 0 to 4 and then stop once count becomes 5.
